# THE EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT’S SOP: PROTOCOL LOGISTICS
**Subject:** Operational Standards for [Client Name]’s Optimization.

## I. Core Objective
Your goal is to ensure that [Client Name]’s environment, nutrition, and training infrastructure remain at The Clarity Standard regardless of their location. You will use the Sovereign Logistics Hub in the app to facilitate this.

## II. Real-Time Location Verification
All locations sourced via the Global Organic Map are verified in real-time. Before finalizing any booking, you must:

1.  **Verify via App:** Check the "Live Status" of the organic supplier or gym in the app.
2.  **The Confirmation Call:** Use the "Protocol Script" below to confirm the kitchen uses Zero Seed Oils and only Organic Produce.

**The Script:**
> "I am calling to confirm a reservation for [Client Name]. It is a medical-grade requirement that all food is prepared in animal fats (Butter/Tallow) or Cold-Pressed Olive Oil. We must strictly avoid Canola, Sunflower, and Grapeseed oils. Can your chef accommodate this for the entire stay?"

## III. Travel & Accommodation Standards
When booking travel, follow these non-negotiable "Clarity Filters":

### 1. The Accommodation Audit
- **Gym:** Must have a pull-up bar or a functional fitness area (for Calisthenics).
- **Environment:** Room must be on a high floor (low noise) with blackout curtains.
- **Minibar:** Request the removal of all high-sugar items and replacement with Glass-Bottled Mineral Water.

### 2. The Supply Chain (Shipping)
If [Client Name] is traveling to a "Low-Map Density" area (limited organic access), use the Sovereign Logistics Hub to ship a Clarity Essentials Box to the destination 48 hours before arrival.

**Contents:** Organic Tallow, Celtic Sea Salt, Blue-Light Blockers, and Organic Beef Jerky.

## IV. Routine Maintenance (The Weekly Audit)
- **Monday:** Sync the Global Organic Map with [Client Name]’s calendar. Pre-book all "Seed-Oil-Free" lunches.
- **Wednesday:** Ensure the organic grocery delivery for the home/office is scheduled and verified for 100% organic certification.
- **Friday:** Review the Hybrid-Mastery Matrix. If [Client Name] is traveling for the weekend, ensure the "Travel Protocol" is printed and placed in their briefcase.
